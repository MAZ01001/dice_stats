# Dice Stats

DND dice rolls and statistics

## How to use

1. Open <https://maz01001.github.io/dice_stats/>
2. Click <kbd>Add roll</kbd> to add a new row.
   1. You can edit the `Name` text to say what ever you whant for example `Strength`.
      - If you clear it and press enter or navigate away from it, it will remove this row without further asking.
   2. Enter a number into the `Value` field to compare to the dice throw (within this row).
   3. Choose a comparison operator.
   4. Then on the right side choose a dice type and click the <kbd>Add</kbd> button next to it, to add that dice to this dice throw (within this row).
      - To remove dice just click on them (while the colored toggle-button at the bottom is red and says <kbd>Click to remove</kbd>).
      - The area where the dice are is also resizable, to reset the sizing to automatic, double-click the lower right corner.
3. Now you can click on <kbd>Roll all</kbd> to roll all dice on the page and see the result.
   - Dice will turn green when they succeed in matching the condition within their row and red if it fails.
   - The border of the entire rectangle will turn green when all dice throws succeed, and red if not.
   - _The border/dice color will remain grey if not all dice where rolled or not all `Value` fields are valid (and non-empty)_.
4. You can also toggle the colored button at the bottom from <kbd>Click to remove</kbd> (red) to <kbd>Point to rotate</kbd> (green) for automatic dice rolling by just moving the mouse over the dice (or clicking on them).

The percentages at the end of each row show how likely it is for any given roll to succeed and at the bottom of the page is the total chance of success over all rolls.

You can also navigate this page with keyboard only (and touch should also work just fine).
